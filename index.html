    <p>
        Since high school, I knew I would be an engineer because I liked to take everything apart and put it back together again.</p>
        
    <p> So I went to the KPI to become a television engineer. In the third year, I went for an internship at a TV channel. 
        At the end of four students, I got an offer for the position of quality control engineer. 
        Then a promotion to IT supports engineer. And another promotion to Video Broadcasting Automation Engineer. 
        At the same time, I was also working as a video broadcast engineer for another TV channel. I was a video streaming superman. </p>
    <p>    
        Then I got noticed by a professional video broadcasting software development company, and I still work in that field, and I still enjoy it. 
    <p>  
        I think this industry will be relevant for a long time, and I have a lot to learn and make excellent products.</p>
    <p>
